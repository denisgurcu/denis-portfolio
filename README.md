## Features

### Interactive Components
- The project includes handmade interactive components, such as custom animations and designs drawn purely with CSS.
- Even the eye is actually a distorted rectangular.
- The cursor picker also pure CSS & JS.

### Matter.js for Physics-Based Animation
- Integrating **Matter.js** was a significant learning experience. 

### Local Storage for Persistent Data
- Color preferences are stored locally and persist across pages.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Locate the file**:

## Challenges
- **Where do I start?**  
  Designing and coding for yourself is incredibly difficult, but it taught me a lot about my skills and what I want to do. 
- **Handling Animations**  
  Implementing animations with CSS, GSAP, and Matter.js required extensive debugging and experimentation.
- **Designing Interactive Components**  
  Creating handmade UI elements pushed my CSS skills further than ever before. (Tailwind I still don't like you.)

## Lessons Learned
1. **Always Back Up Your Work**  
   One mistake is all it takes to lose days of progress.ü•π
2. **React Isn‚Äôt That Bad**  
   I was considering to move the project out of React, but I might keep. I‚Äôm learning to embrace its difficulties and appreciate its power.
3. **Practice**  
   Regular commits, pushes, and deployments have finally thought me how to use Git workflow.
4. **It‚Äôs IMPOSSIBLE to Design for Yourself**  
   Self-reflection delays decisions. Moving faster and changing later is key.
5. **Embrace the Process**  
   After countless breakdowns, self-doubt, and identity crisis, it's time to embrace the process.
